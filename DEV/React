2 types of engines -- 1)layout engine  -- html css load hoti hai 
                      2)JS engine 

html css load hoti hai , uske baad js aati hai 
toh uske beech ka time is called hydration process \

>async and differ
>JS only understood by browser 

What is babel -- it is a library / compiler (transpiler (transfer and compile))
(jsx ko convert krta hai into pure js so that browser can understand it )

bhot saari js files ko ek mein karne ke liye we use bundles 
Some bundlers are :
>webpacks(unwanted waste code -- worst hai )
>vite
>parcel

2 components
1-class based - stateful  (dynamic changes)
2-functional - stateless (static changes) 


Hooks -- predefined functions 
with the use of hooks we could make functional components dynamic 

2 types of exports - 
default - default export kisi bhi naam se import kr skte hai 
named - for named export we need to destructur it 

make sure ki component ka naam capital mein ho as agar import/render small name se kiya toh unrecognized bolega wo 

props (attributes) -- these are also objects

variables/state can change but the change in it is not re-rendering the components 
So to overcome it hooks aaye 

yeh dynamic change hai variable/state mein 



Reconsilation -- process which is working/running behind in the comparison of two DOM's
compare krne ke baad konsi chiz banegi ya nhi banegi yeh batayega Reconsilation


Memo --- memoization (predefined function)
checks the props if it is changed or not 
if prop does not change toh no change no rerendering 
if prop changes toh  change hoa hoga to rerender kro  


Batching -- saare updation ke baad 1 baar rerender hoga
